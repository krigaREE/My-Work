    <p class="about-me-text">

      My name is Dordea Robert, and at the young age of 23, I've already carved a notable path in the poker scene. My journey into the world of poker began at 17, adopting the alias "krigaREE." It was after two years of intense dedication and an unwavering passion for the game that I proudly embraced the title of a professional poker player. Poker is not just a game to me; it's been my sole source of income, allowing me to live a life many only dream of.

      Under the mentorship of esteemed players Brian Fite, also known as "bfizz11," and Drummond, recognized by his alias "BBZPoker," my poker skills were honed to a professional edge. Their guidance was instrumental in shaping my approach to the game and in my development as a player.

      My involvement in the Romanian poker community has been deeply rewarding. I've forged numerous connections, and it's fair to say that if you're a professional in the scene, there's a high chance you've heard of me. My track record speaks volumes of my dedication and skill, boasting an impressive 33 wins and no losses in high-stakes, head-to-head battles. Furthermore, my tournament earnings exceed *private* , a figure that only scratches the surface of my total profit, much of which remains unrecorded.

      My journey in poker is a testament to hard work, passion, and the invaluable relationships built along the way. As I continue to evolve and grow in this ever-challenging sport, I remain committed to not just maintaining, but surpassing, the high standards I've set for myself.</p>

      Poker is a card game that combines gambling, strategy, and skill. The basic rules involve players betting on the strength of their card hand in several rounds of betting. Players are dealt cards, some of which are private and some of which may be shared with other players at the table. The goal is to have the best hand or to bluff your opponents into folding. The game variants include Texas Hold'em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud, each with its own set of specific rules regarding the number of cards dealt, betting procedures, and hand rankings.<br>
      No Limit Texas Hold'em is a popular poker variant played in tournaments and cash games worldwide. <br>Here's an overview of its rules:<br>

      1. **The Basics**: Each player is dealt two private cards ("hole cards") that belong to them alone. Five community cards are dealt face-up on the "board." All players in the game use these shared community cards in conjunction with their hole cards to each make their best possible five-card poker hand.<br>

      2. **Blinds**: The game uses a rotating dealer mechanism. The player to the left of the dealer is the small blind, and the player to the left of the small blind is the big blind. These positions force mandatory bets of a predetermined amount and ensure there's always money in the pot.<br>

      3. **Betting Rounds**:
      - **Pre-Flop**: After seeing their hole cards, each player now has the option to play their hand by calling or raising the big blind. The action begins to the left of the big blind, which is considered a "live" bet on this round.
      - **The Flop**: Three community cards are dealt face up on the board. Another round of betting ensues, starting with the player to the left of the dealer.
      - **The Turn**: A fourth community card is dealt, followed by another round of betting.
      - **The River**: The final community card is dealt. The last round of betting occurs. <br>

      4. **Betting Actions**: Players have the option to check (decline to make a bet while retaining their cards), bet (place a wager), call (match another player's bet), raise (increase the bet amount), or fold (discard their hand and forfeit interest in the pot).<br>

      5. **No Limit Betting**: In No Limit Texas Hold'em, there's no bet limit, so any player can bet all of their chips at any point in the betting round.<br>

      6. **Showdown**: If there are two or more players left after the final betting round, a showdown occurs. The player who bet on the river is the first to show their hand. If there was no bet, the player to the left of the dealer shows their hand first. The player with the best five-card hand wins the pot.<br>

      7. **Hand Rankings**: From highest to lowest, the possible hands are Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind, Two Pair, One Pair, High Card.<br>

      These rules provide the framework for playing No Limit Texas Hold'em, but strategies and nuanced play styles emerge from this structure, making it a complex and intriguing game.<br>
